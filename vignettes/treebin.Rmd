#Introduction

In this vignette, we introduce the basic functionality of the `treebinr` package, by using the methodology of `GapBin` which is the default functionality. Technical details can be found in the accompanying `GapBin` vignette, and the accompanying JSS vignette.

# Object Classes

The `treebin` package works with two object classes, `bin` and `treebinr`. The `bin` object class is used internally in `treebin`, and is also part of the output provided by the function. It is an S4 class with the following slots:

|Slot     |Contents |
|--------:|:--------|
|boundary | A function to test the inclusion of a point in the bin (i.e. a `boundaryTest` function) |
|contents | A matrix containing the points in the bin |
|measure  | The measure (as computed by `binMeasure`) associated with the bin |
|index    | The index relating the bin to the internal decision tree |
|info     | Additional information specified by the user |

The `treebinr` object is the final output provided by `treebin`. It is an S4 object with the following slots:

|Slot     |Contents |
|--------:|:--------|
|points | A matrix containing the representative points of each bin |
|counts | A numeric vector containing the number of points in each bin |
|bins  | A list containing the final `bin` objects created during the `treebin` process |
|tree    | A matrix representing an directed graph of the binning process|

# The Main Function - treebin

The main function available in the `treebinr` package is `treebin`, which takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
treebin <- function(X, 
                    numbins, 
                    binMeasure = gapMeasure,
                    boundaryTest = gapBoundaryTest,
                    selectBin = gapSelect,
                    splitBin = gapSplit,
                    makePoint = gapPoint,
                    binInfo = list(binRange = sapply(1:ncol(X), FUN = function(j){range(X[,j])})),
                    inputs = list(dimRange = sapply(1:ncol(X), FUN = function(j){range(X[,j])}))){
```

The input variable `X` is a matrix object containing the $n \times p$ matrix of points to be binned, and `numbins` is a numeric variable specifying the desired number of points in the binned configuration. Although the remaining input variables have supplied defaults, `treebin` is set up to allow complete customization of the binning process. The following subsections will detail the requirements of each input variable, and demonstrate how a prospective user can create their own binning methodology using the `treebinr` framework.

The output of `treebin` is a `treebinr` object.

## binMeasure

The `binMeasure` function takes the following form

```{r, eval=FALSE}
binMeasure <- function(bin, 
                       inputs = NULL)
```

Here, the `bin` input variable is an object of class `bin` on which we would like to compute (or update) the `measure` slot of the object. The `inputs` variable is a named list containing all of the additional information required to execute the function, with a default value of NULL. For instance, in the built in `gapMeasure` function, the range of each dimension is required to compute the measure for each bin, as well as `tau`, a numeric input. These are passed to the `binMeasure` function as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
inputs <- list(dimRange = sapply(1:nCols, FUN = function(j) {diff(range(X[,j]))}),
               tau = 1)
```

The intended use of `binMeasure` is to act as a score (or be something that can be interpreted as a score) during the bin selection stage. The output of `binMeasure`, however, is entirely up to the user, but must be compatible with the `selectBin` function, which is also user defined. For instance, in the `gapBin` methodology, `binMeasure` returns a matrix containing the computed gaps between all points in the bin, and the `selectBin` function manipulates this matrix for each `bin` object, and chooses the bin to be split (see the `GapBin` vignette for more information). 

A very simple example would be to assign each bin a score equivalent to the number of points it contains:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

binMeasure <- function(bin, 
                       inputs = NULL){
  out <- nrow(bin@contents)
  return(out)
}

```

## selectBin

The `selectBin` function takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
selectBin <- function(bins,
                      inputs = NULL)
```

The `bins` input variable is now a list object containing all of the `bin` objects to date, and the `inputs` variable is once again a named list containing any addition information required in the `selectBin` function. 

The intended use of `selectBin` is to evaluate, or choose between, the `measure` slots of each `bin` object, to choose the bin that will be split in the current iteration. As with all of the other functions, `selectBin` is completely general, so the user can include any other steps required to find this bin. For example, in the `GapBin` methodology, `selectBin` first finds the maximum `measure` value from each `bin` object (recall the `measure` slot contains matrices), before determining which bin is to be chosen. 

Continuing with the example from the previous section, suppose we wanted to simply split the bin that had the largest number of points. Since our `measure` slot in each bin is the bin counts, we need only choose the bin that has the largest measure:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
selectBin <- function(bins,
                      inputs = NULL){
  out <- sapply(bins,
                FUN = function(bin){bin@measure})
  return(which.max(out))
}
```

## splitBin

The `splitBin` function is used to split a single bin into several using a custom method specified by the user. It takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
splitBin <- function(bin, binMeasure, inputs)
```

Here, the `bin` input is a `bin` object to be split, `binMeasure` is the function used to determine the measure associated with the newly formed bins, and `inputs` is a named list containing any addtional information required in `splitBin`. The function must return a list containing newly constructed `bin` objects.

The function can be quite complex, as it requires new bin objects to be constructed. Suppose that we have chosen a bin, but we don't care on which dimension the split occurs. A proper function would take the following form.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapSplit <- function(bin, binMeasure, inputs){
  
  #Extract the bin information
  currentMeasure <- bin@measure
  currentBin <- bin@contents
  currentBoundary <- bin@info$binRange

  #Find the maximum measure in each dimension, and take the overall maximum as the dimension to be split
  whichAxis <- sample(1:nrow(currenBin), 1)
  
  #sort the bin along the chosen axis
  sortedBin <- currentBin[order(currentBin[,whichAxis]),]
  
  #Split the sorted bin at the maximum gap
  gapIndex <- which.max(currentMeasure[,whichAxis])
  
  leftContents <- sortedBin[seq(1, gapIndex, 1),,drop=FALSE]
  rightContents <- sortedBin[seq(gapIndex + 1, nrow(currentBin), 1),,drop=FALSE]
  
  #Define the new bin boundaries
  newBoundary <- (max(leftContents[,whichAxis]) + min(rightContents[,whichAxis]))/2   #Split at the midpoint of the maximum gap
  
  leftBoundary <- currentBoundary
  leftBoundary[2,whichAxis] <- newBoundary #The boundary of the left leaf is the same as the parent, except a new maximum along the split dimension
  
  rightBoundary <- currentBoundary
  rightBoundary[1,whichAxis] <- newBoundary  #The boundary of the right leaf is the same as the parent, except a new minimum along the split dimension
  
  #Put together the new bins in a binfo object
  leftBin <- bin(boundary = bin@boundary, contents = leftContents, measure = NULL, info = list(binRange = leftBoundary))
  rightBin <- bin(boundary = bin@boundary, contents = rightContents, measure = NULL, info = list(binRange = rightBoundary))
  
  #Compute the new bin measures
  leftBin@measure <- binMeasure(leftBin, inputs)
  rightBin@measure <- binMeasure(rightBin, inputs)
  
  #Return the new bins in a list
  return(list(leftBin, rightBin))
  
}
```

## makePoint

The `makePoint` function is used after all of the desired split have been determined (i.e. we have achieved `numbins` bins), and determines the representative point for each bin. It takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
makePoint <- function(bin,
                      inputs = NULL)
```

Again, the `bin` input is an object `bin`, and `inputs` is a named list variable containing additional inputs for `makePoint`. The function must return a vector objects containing the representative point.

A simple choice, and the one used in `GapBin`, is to simply take the by-dimension mean of the contents in the bin:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
makePoint <- function(bin,
                      inputs = NULL){
  point <- apply(bin@contents, 2, mean)
  return(point)
}
```

## binInfo and inputs

The `binInfo` object is simply a named list object containing any additional information that the user would like to include with additional bins. FOr instance, in the `GapBin` methodology, the maximum/minimum of each bin is stored for use in `boundaryTest`. Thus, at initialization of the algorithm, the initial bin needs to contain the range of the original data, so `binInfo` is constructed as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
binInfo <- list(binRange = sapply(1:nCols, FUN = function(j) {range(X[,j])}))
```

Similarly, the `inputs` variable contains any additional information that the user requires within `treebin`, but is not necessarily needed in each bin. For instance, in `GapBin`, to compute the bin measure, the algorithm requires the range of the original dimensions of the data and an additional input variable `tau`. As such, the `inputs` variable takes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
inputs <- list(dimRange = sapply(1:nCols, FUN = function(j) {diff(range(X[,j]))}),
               tau = 1)
```

## boundaryTest

The `boundaryTest` function is required in the `addPoint` function (discussed in later sections). It is attached to each `bin` individually (stored in the `boundary` slot of the `bin` object), meaning that a user could (potentially) have a a unique test for individual bins. It has the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
boundaryTest <- function(point,
                            bin,
                            inputs = NULL)
```

Here, the `point` input is a vector containing the point to be tested, the `bin` input is a `bin` object for which we would like to test the point, and the `inputs` variable is a named list containing any additional inputs required.

For the case where the bins are rectangular, a test of inclusion simply involves checking if the point falls within the rectangular bounds of each bin. This is why, for `GapBin`, the bin maximum/minimum is carried along in the `info` slot of each `bin` object.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
boundaryTest <- function(point, bin, inputs){
  
  point <- matrix(point,nrow=1)
  boundary <- bin@info$binRange
  indicator <- c()
  
  for(i in 1:ncol(point)){
    indicator <- c(indicator, (point[i] < boundary[2,i] & point[i] > boundary[1,i]))
  }
  
  if(all(indicator)){
    return(TRUE)
  }else{
    return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

# An Example using the GapBin Methodology

All of the required input to execute the `GapBin` methodology (which is described in detail in the `GapBin` vignette) is implemented as the default behaviour of `treebin`. Consider decreasing the size of a bivariate normal point configuration of size 1000 to 500 using the `GapBin` methodology of `treebin`

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
set.seed(1337)
X <- matrix(rnorm(2000),ncol=2)
numbins <- 500

binMeasure <- gapMeasure
selectBin <- gapSelect
splitBin <- gapSplit
boundaryTest <- gapBoundaryTest
makePoint <- gapPoints
dimRange <- sapply(1:ncol(X), FUN = function(j) {diff(range(X[,j]))})
inputs <- list(dimRange = dimRange, tau=1)
binInfo <- list(binRange = sapply(1:ncol(X), FUN = function(j) {range(X[,j])}))

out <- treebin(X, numbins, binMeasure, boundaryTest, selectBin, splitBin, makePoint, binInfo, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(X), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

# Supplementary Functions

The `treebinr` package has a number of supplementary functions that act on the output provided by the `treebin` object.

## addPoint

As the name suggests, the `addPoint` function adds a point to the already binned configuration by first determining the existing bin to which it belongs, and then updating the bin by adding the point to it. The function takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
addPoint(point,
         treebinr_obj,
         binMeasure,
         makePoint,
         inputs = NULL)
```

Here, `point` is a numeric vector containing the point to be added, `treebinr_obj` is an object of class `treebinr` to which the point will be added, `binMeasure` and `makePoint` are the user defined functions to compute the measure of the bin and create the representative point respectively, and `inputs` is a named list containing additional inputs to the function.

Continuing with the example above, consider adding a point to the configuration at $(-3,3)$. The image on the left is the binned configuration, and the image on the right is the binned configuration with a point added at $(-3,3)$ (and incorporated into the representative point for the bin in which it fell)

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

point <- c(-3,3)
treebinr <- out      #From the original bin done above
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
makePoint <- gapPoints
inputs <- list(tau = 1, dimRange = dimRange)

out2 <- addPoint(point, treebinr, binMeasure, makePoint,  inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out2@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=1)
```

##doNextSplit

Suppose we were interested in seeing what the next split in the sequence would be if we had requested the algorithm to produce one additional bin. Alternatively, suppose we added a point in an obscure location (such as we did above), and we wanted to see if producing one additional point would seperate the added point. 

The `doNextSplit` function accomplishes this task, and takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
doNextSplit(treebinr_obj, selectBin, splitBin, binMeasure, makePoint, inputs)
```

As before, the `treebinr_obj` is an object of class `treebinr` eminating from the `treebin` function, `selectBin`, `splitBin`, `binMeasure`, and `makePoint` are the user supplied functions to select, split, compute the measure, and compute the representative point of the bin respectively, and `inputs` is a named list of additional input variables.

As an example, consider performing the next split on the configuration with the added point from above. The image on the left is of the confguration with the additional point added, and the image on the right the same configuration after executing one additional split.

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

treebin_obj <- out2
selectBin <- gapSelect
splitBin <- gapSplit
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
inputs <- list(tau = 1, dimRange = dimRange)

out3 <- doNextSplit(treebin_obj, selectBin, splitBin, binMeasure, makePoint, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out2@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out3@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

## undoLastSplit

Suppose we weren't happy with the results of `doNextSplit`, or we wanted to explore having fewer bins in the configuration. For this purpose, we can use the `undoLastSplit` function, which works opposite the `doNextSplit` function. Using the stored tree, we are able to traverse it in reverse, undoing the last split performed by the `treebin` function.

The `undoLastSplit` function takes the following form

```{r, eval=FALSE}
undoLastSplit(treebinr_obj, binMeasure, makePoint, updateBin, inputs)
```

Where as before, `treebinr_obj` is an object of class `treebinr`, `binMeasure` and `makePoint` are user supplied functions to compute the measure and representative point of the newly formed bin, and `inputs` is again a named list containing additional variables. The new input not seen before is `updateBin`, which is a user supplied function that takes a set of pre-determined bins (i.e. the bins that are being joined), and turns them into a single `bin` object. The function takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateBin(bins, binMeasure, inputs)
```

Here, `bins` is a list containing the `bin` objects to be combined, `binMeasure` is the function to compute the measure of the newly formed bin, and `inputs` is a named list containing additional variables.

As an example, suppose we wanted to undo the split we performed in the previous step:

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

treebinr_obj <- out3 
binMeasure <- gapMeasure 
makePoint <- gapPoints
updateBin <- gapUpdate 
inputs <- list(tau = 1, dimRange = dimRange)

out4 <- undoLastSplit(treebinr_obj, binMeasure, makePoint, updateBin, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out3@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out4@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

## split

Suppose instead of wanting to simply execute the next split as chosen by the `treebin` algorithm, we instead had a specifi bin that we wanted to split. For the purpose, we use `split`, which has the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
split(bin, treebinr_obj, binMeasure, splitBin, makePoint, inputs)
```

Here, `bin` is an object of class `bin` to be split, `treebinr_obj` is an object of class `treebinr`, `binMeasure`, `splitBin`, and `makePoint` are user defined functions to compute the measure, split, and compute the representative point of the newly formed bins respectively, and `inputs` is a named list object containing additional input variables.

As an example, we split a random node from the original binned configuration. The configuration on the left is the original binned configuration, and the figure on the right is the configuration with an additional split node.

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
target <- out@bins[[490]]

treebinr_obj <- out
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
makePoint <- gapPoints
inputs <- inputs

out5 <- split(target, out, binMeasure, gapSplit, gapPoints, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out5@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

## prune

Suppose now we want to go in the opposite direction - instead of splitting a given node, we want to re-combine it with its sister nodes (an operation generally known as pruning). For this purpose, we have `prune`, which takes a `bin` object as input, and combines it with all of its sister nodes to create a single node. It takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
prune(bin, treebinr_obj, binMeasure, makePoint, updateBin, inputs)
```

where `bin` is the bin object to be pruned, `treebinr_obj` is an objcet of class `treebinr`, `binMeasure`, `makePoint`, and `updateBin` are user supplied functions to compute the bin measure, create the updated bin, and compute the representative point, and `inputs` is a named list containing any additional variables.

We consider a simple example of pruning an arbitrarily chosen bin. The image on the left is the original binned configuration, and the image on the right is the pruned configuration.

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
set.seed(1337)
 
node <- out@bins[[sample(1:500, 1)]]
treebinr_obj <- out
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
makePoint <- gapPoints
inputs <- inputs

out7 <- prune(node, treebinr_obj, binMeasure, makePoint, gapUpdate, inputs)


p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out7@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

## trim

Once we have a binned configuration, we may want to combine bins that have a low `measure` value, an operation generally referred to as trimming. For this operation, we use the function `trim`, which takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trim(val,
     treebinr_obj,
     getMeasure = function(bin, inputs){bin@measure},
     binMeasure,
     makePoint,
     updateBin,
     inputs = NULL)
```

where `val` is the maximum value of `measure` to retain (i.e. all nodes with a lower value of measure will be combined with their sister nodes), `treebinr_obj` is an object of class `treebinr`, `binMeasure`, `updateBin`, and `makePoint` are function to compute the bin measure, create the newly formed bin, and create its representative point respectively. The `getMeasure` input is a user supplied function to extract, and possibly alter, the measure values of each `bin` object. The default value is to simply extract the measure of each bin.

For our previous example, consider trimming all nodes with a meaure value below $0.01$:

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
val <- .01
treebinr_obj <- out 
getMeasure <- function(bin, inputs){
  max <- max(bin@measure)
  return(max)
}
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
makePoint <- gapPoints  
boundaryTest <- gapBoundaryTest
updateBin <- gapUpdate 
inputs <- inputs

out8 <- trim(val, treebinr_obj, getMeasure, binMeasure, makePoint, updateBin, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out8@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

## trimTo

Suppose instead of trimming below a specific measure threshold, we instead wanted to trim the configuration to a given number of points. To do this, we use the `trimTo` function, which first computes the value of `measure` that would result in a trim to the desired bumber of points, before executing the `trim` function discussed above. `trimTo` takes the following form:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trimTo <- function(num, 
                   treebinr_obj,
                   getMeasure = function(bin, inputs){bin@measure},
                   binMeasure,
                   makePoint,
                   updateBin,
                   inputs = NULL)
```

where the only input that differs from those in `trim` is `num`, the number of desired points in the trimmed configuration.

Where we previously binned the configuration to 500 bins, suppose we wanted only 350. We can do this in one of two way: Binning the original configuration directly to 350 bins, or trim the previously binned configuration back to 350. The result is two interestingly different configurations (direct binning on the left, trimming on the right).

```{r,  fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

numbins <- 350

#Bin the original configuration directly to 350
out9 <- treebin(X, numbins, binMeasure, boundaryTest, selectBin, splitBin, makePoint, binInfo, inputs)

#Trim the 500 bin configuration to 350
treebinr_obj <- out 
getMeasure <- function(bin, inputs){
  max <- max(bin@measure)
  return(max)
}
binMeasure <- gapMeasure
makePoint <- gapPoints  
boundaryTest <- gapBoundaryTest
updateBin <- gapUpdate 
inputs <- inputs

out10 <- trimTo(numbins, treebinr_obj, getMeasure, binMeasure, makePoint, updateBin, inputs)

p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out9@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(out10@points), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=.5) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  theme_bw()

grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```
